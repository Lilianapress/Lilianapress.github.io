                                              Python, demonstrated through my extensive use of libraries such as <strong>NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and
                                              netCDF4</strong>. These tools have been instrumental in various applications throughout my Ph.D. research,
                                              allowing me to effectively analyze, manipulate, and visualize large datasets, particularly in the
                                              realm of atmospheric science. Additionally, I've applied machine learning techniques using TensorFlow
                                              and scikit-learn to extract insights and patterns from complex data sets.

                                            I possess proficiency in a diverse range of machine learning techniques, including <strong>neural 
                                            networks,convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), recurrent neural 
                                            networks (RNNs), autoencoders, and principal component analysis (PCA)</strong>. Throughout my
                                            research, I have leveraged these advanced algorithms to tackle diverse challenges in atmospheric 
                                            science and air pollution modeling. By employing cutting-edge machine learning methods, I have 
                                            successfully extracted patterns, generated predictions, and enhanced data-driven insights, 
                                            contributing significantly to my Ph.D. research outcomes.
                                           <li>Data Analysis</li>
                                           My data analysis experience encompasses a comprehensive range of methodologies, including performance 
                                           analysis, sensitivity analysis, and statistical analysis. Through meticulous examination and 
                                           interpretation of data, I have gained insights into system behaviors, identified key variables 
                                           impacting outcomes, and evaluated model performance. Leveraging techniques such as sensitivity analysis
                                           , I have quantified the influence of input parameters on model outputs, enabling robust decision-making. 
                                           Additionally, my proficiency in statistical analysis has allowed me to draw meaningful conclusions, 
                                           infer relationships, and validate hypotheses, enhancing the depth and reliability of my research findings.
