            <h2>My Ph.D 2018 - Present</h2>
        </header>
        <p>I began my Ph.D. journey in 2018 at Carleton University, where I joined the Carleton Air
           Quality Group. This period was packed with adventures, and I gained valuable insights across
           various areas. Check out the list below to see the technical models and tools I've become
           proficient in!</p>

                        (CMAQ) is a widely used atmospheric model developed by the United States
                        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for simulating air quality and
                        atmospheric chemistry. It helps analyze the impacts of emissions on air
                        quality and assesses the effectiveness of pollution control strategies.</span>
